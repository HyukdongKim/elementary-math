%Solutions to problems go below.  Please follow the guidelines from https://www.overleaf.com/read/sfbcjxcgsnsk/


%Copy the following block of text for each problem in the assignment.
\begin{problem}{1} 
Show that $u_{\alpha\alpha}+u_{\beta\beta}=0$. s.t. $u_{xx}-6u_{xy}+12u_{yy}=0$.
\end{problem}
\begin{sol}
    \begin{align}
        & u_{xx}-6u_{xy}+12u_{yy}=0 & \label{eq:1} \\
        & \Leftrightarrow (\partial_{xx}-6\partial_{xy}+12\partial_{yy})u=0 & \label{eq:2} \\
        & \Leftrightarrow ((\partial_{x}-3\partial_{y})^2+3\partial_{yy})u=0 & \label{eq:3}
    \end{align}
    From equation \eqref{eq:3}, we can get
    \begin{align}
        x & = 1 \cdot \alpha + 0 \cdot \beta = \alpha \label{eq:4} \\
        y & = -3 \cdot \alpha + \sqrt{3} \cdot \beta  = -3 \alpha + \sqrt{3} \beta& \label{eq:5}
    \end{align}
    From equation \eqref{eq:4} and \eqref{eq:5}, we can get
    \begin{align}
        u_{\alpha} & = 1 \cdot u_{x} + (-3) \cdot u_{y} = u_{x}-3 u_{y}\label{eq:6} \\
        u_{\beta} & = 0 \cdot u_{x} + \sqrt{3} \cdot u_{y} =\qquad \sqrt{3} u_{y} \label{eq:7} 
    \end{align}
    From equation \eqref{eq:6} and \eqref{eq:7}, we can get
    \begin{align}
        \partial_{\alpha} & = \partial_{x} -3 \partial_{y} \label{eq:8} \\
        \partial_{\beta} & = \sqrt{3} \partial_{y} \label{eq:9} 
    \end{align}
    And, we can get
    \begin{align}
        \partial_{\alpha\alpha} & = \partial_{\alpha} \partial_{\alpha} = \partial_{\alpha}^2 \nonumber \\
        & = (\partial_{x}-3\partial_{y})^2  (\because \textrm{Eq.} \eqref{eq:8}) \nonumber \\
        & = \partial_{xx} -6 \partial_{xy} + 9 \partial_{yy} \label{eq:10}
    \end{align}
    \begin{align}
        \partial_{\beta\beta} & = \partial_{\beta} \partial_{\beta} = (\partial_{\beta})^2 \nonumber \\
        & = (\sqrt{3}\partial_{y})^2 (\because \textrm{Eq.} \eqref{eq:9}) \nonumber \\
        & = 3 \partial_{yy} \label{eq:11}
    \end{align}
    Thus,
    \begin{align}
        u_{\alpha\alpha} + u_{\beta\beta} & = \underbrace{(\partial_{xx} -6 \partial_{xy} + 9 \partial_{yy})}_{\textrm{Eq.} \eqref{eq:10}} + \underbrace{(3\partial_{yy})}_{\textrm{Eq.} \eqref{eq:11}} \nonumber \\
        & = \partial_{xx} - 6 \partial_{xy} + 12\partial_{yy} \nonumber \\
        & = 0 \nonumber (\because \textrm{Eq.} \eqref{eq:2}) \nonumber
    \end{align}
\end{sol}
